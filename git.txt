Add remote repository as an origin: -

git remote add origin "github https url link"

fetch all the files from github: -

git pull origin main

or 

git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories



Making Changes: -
Commit changes add files to the index first

git status -- for checking files added to index and are ready to commit.

git add    -- lets you add files to your index


git commit -- checking the snapshots of the repository at a given time. Committed snapshots will never change unless done explicitly.


all the files added at once

git add -A  --- then check the git status


similarly with commit add all the files at once
